title:  "Who wants to be a Millionaire esque app made with Next.js and tailwind"
comments: "I used next.js and tailwind for this app to learn more about them. Later, i'd like to improve the helper buttons and implement 'ask the audience' etc."
description:  "I made this for a friend of mine as he really enjoys quizing. There is an internal database of questions, and I wanted to make it so more sets can be added by a non technical user. Then it can cycle through the different sets of questions to give the user a different ranges like the game show does."
