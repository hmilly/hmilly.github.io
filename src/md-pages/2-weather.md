title: "Weather app that calls data from an API made with React, Typescript and SASS "
comments: "This is a simple weather app I made for someone. I used typescript with React to learn more about how they work with each other. I also used SASS as I really enjoy the readability and cleanliness of it"
description:  "Further along, i'd like to make this site more complex in terms of what data is shown, as there is much more from the API. I struggled intially to keep the personal API key hidden but vercel helps greatly with this"
