description: "This is a React based app that uses Typescript, SASS and utilises open source APIs. The user enters a city name using a location API, selects it from the dropdown, then detailed weather info is displayed from the weather API."
comments: "I used TS with React to learn more about how they work with each other. I chose SASS to style as I really enjoy the readability and cleanliness of it."
