title: "YouTube clone with data from an API, using Gatsby"
comments: "I made this app with Gatsby and an internal DB taken from RapidAPI. I also used styled components with css grid. Later I'd like to optimise the page, implement a proper API db and find a better source for the data."
description:  "I found this to be a great exercise and really easy to do. I wanted to do everything from scratch to prove I could pull off a copy cat website, which I think I succeeded at."
