title: "An artist website to promote a body of work. Created using svelte"
comments: "I decided to use svelte as I have heard a lot about it, and thought it would be a great opportunity for me to learn something new. For the css I used grid and flexbox."
description:  "I made this for someone that I work with as he has a real passion for art, and discussed the desire to make a website to display it. I'd later like to improve the login page for the site owner."
