description: "I am currently in the process of finishing this website. It offers the ability for artists to sign up and upload a body of work. Other users can also sign up to browse the site, allowing them to contact artists and register their interests in their work"
comments: "I created this site with React, bootstrap and firebase. This project has allowed me to get to grips with bootstrap and provided me with range of skills for firebase too, including how to authenticate users and generally use the DB."
