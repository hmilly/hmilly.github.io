## Frontend developer - London N4
This is the repository for my frontend developer profile.
It's where I have included projects that I've made.
Such as:

- A website for a cleaning company created for my cousin
- A weather app which is connected to an API for working location and weather details
- An artists website showcasing their work
- A restaurant website which has a functional checkout
- A selling website using firebase and using my earlier artists store
- A single page quiz based on 'who wants to be a millionaire'
