## Frontend developer - London N4
This is the repository for my frontend developer profile.
It's where I have included projects that I've made.
Such as:

- A spa quiz based on 'who wants to be a millionaire
- A weather app which is connected to an API for location and weather details
- An artists website showcasing their work
- A restaurant website that has a functional checkout
- A starter game website with 1 game included (whack a mole)
- Finally, a clone website based off of youtube in early 2021
